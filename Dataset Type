I'm using Dataset from google that contains detailed specifications and official launch prices of various mobile phone models from different companies. 
It provides insights into smartphone hardware, pricing trends, and brand competitiveness across multiple countries. 
The dataset includes key features such as RAM, camera specifications, battery capacity, processor details, and screen size.

In the dataset it gives features like:
  Company Name: The brand or manufacturer of the mobile phone.
  Model Name: The specific model of the smartphone.
  Mobile Weight: The weight of the mobile phone (in grams).
  RAM: The amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) in the device (in GB).
  Front Camera: The resolution of the front (selfie) camera (in MP).
  Back Camera: The resolution of the primary rear camera (in MP).
  Processor: The chipset or processor used in the device.
  Battery Capacity: The battery size of the smartphone (in mAh).
  Screen Size: The display size of the smartphone (in inches).
  Launched Price: (Pakistan, India, China, USA, Dubai): The official launch price of the mobile in the respective country at the time of its release. Prices vary based on the year the mobile was launched.
  Launched Year: The year the mobile phone was officially launched.

But I modify it like removing unneccessary rows and column and add some column (VAT, price in Cambodia currency) to make it in context of Cambodia
